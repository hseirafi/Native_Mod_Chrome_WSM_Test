## About


##  Install & Run


## Start

Configuration: node-gyp configure.
Build: node-gyp build

## How to Run Tests

Currently, tests are run outside of the Docker container (unfortunately for now). The tests use an in-memory version of MongoDB. You should be able to run `npm install` followed by `npm test` to run everything (assuming you have the LTS version of Node installed on your machine).

## App Structure

- the boilerplate entity is called "Thing" and all the routes are based on the thing resource. When you want to start building a real API, you can probably just do a global find and replace for thing, but mind the case-sensitivity.
- most folders have an `index.js` which simply exports the contents of all the files in those folders. This is to make importing things around the app slightly easier, since you can just `require` the folder name and destructure the functions you are looking for. Check out [this part of the Node.js docs](https://nodejs.org/api/modules.html#modules_folders_as_modules) for more info.

**\_\_tests\_\_**

- this folder contains unit and integration tests both run using `npm test` which in turn uses [Jest](https://jestjs.io/)

**./app**

- `handlers` are Express.js route handlers that have `request`, `response`, and `next` parameters.
- `helpers` are raw JS "classes" and utility functions for use across the app
- `models` are [Mongoose schema](https://mongoosejs.com/docs/guide.html) definitions and associated models
- `routers` are RESTful route declarations using [express.Router module](https://expressjs.com/en/guide/routing.html) that utilize the functions in `handlers`
- `schemas` are [JSONSchema](https://json-schema.org/understanding-json-schema/index.html) validation schemas for creating or updating a Thing. Pro-tip: use [JSONSchema.net](https://jsonschema.net/) to generate schemas based on examples for you.
- `app.js` is what builds and configures the express app
- `config.js` is the app-specific config that you will want to customize for your app
- `index.js` is the entrypoint that actually starts the Express server

**./config**

- config contains NGINX proxy configuration, the production pm2 configuration (the process-runner of choice), and the Jest configuration to run MongoDB in memory
